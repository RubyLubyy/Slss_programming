So far, all the lists we've used are one-dimensional.
```python  
some-list = ["blue", "red", "green"]  
```We can create two-dimensional lists that in short, are multiple lists inside a bigger list.```python  
som_ 2d_list = [  
[1,2,3],  
[4,5,6],  
[7,8,9]  
]  
   # r  c  
some_2d_list[0][0] # -> 1  
some_2d_list[0][1] # -> 2  
```

TuplesTuples (toopels or tuhpels) are like lists except for one main thing.Tuples are immutable. Immutable means that
