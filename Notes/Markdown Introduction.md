## Heading
To create headings, we use hash symbols
We can also create different "levels" headings
To create subheadings, we use multiple hashes

## Modifying Text Style
We can use asterisks(*) to modify text style, specifically bold and italics
I want this **word** to be bold
I want this word* to be italics
I want this ***word*** to be bold and italics

## Aside: Escape Characters
If we want to place a character that is ALREADY a keyword or **reserved character** we use the back slash(\\)

## Strikethrough
We can strike through characters or words using the tilde(~)
E.g. 
~~This whole sentence is a mistake

## Link
Links allow us to reference information externally
[A tool **YOU** might use](https://chat.openai.com)

Exercise:
Ask chatgpt to make 2 links to any website using markdown

## Block Quotes
Block quotes allow us to emphasize a bigger chank of text,
We use carets (>) to create blockquotes
Eg. 
>This is an example of a blockquote
>This is line two of a blockquote

## Lists 
We can create both ordered and unordered lists

## Unordered Lists
To create each point, we use asterisks(\*) with a space behind 
We can create
Eg.
* Dairy
	* Eggs
	* Milk
	* Cheese

## Ordered Lists
If there is a specific order to the elements in our list,
we can create an ordered list
We use numbers, followed by periods to create ordered lists
Eg. 
1. Put butter into mixing bowl
2. Add sugar to butter(*hold shift to create a second line*)
   Both brown and granulated sugar should be added
3. Using the mixer, cream sugar and butter together

## Tables
We can organize information in tables using Markdown
We use dashed(-) and pipes(|)
Tables in Markdown requires headings
Eg. 

| Name     | Age    | Sign   |
| ---      | ---    | ---    |
|Abcd      | 10     | idk    |
|Your name | ur age | ur sign|
